        Before the bootcamp, I worked in a variety of positions in the construction, manufacturing, and 
        transportation industries. Although I enjoyed many of these jobs, I wanted to pursue a career in
        a field that offered better opportunities. After researchng career paths and related training 
        programs, I decided to pursue a career in software development.
